# Blood-Bank-Management
A blood bank management system is a website that will collect the information from volunteers and store it in the donor's list. In the future, if anybody registers a need for blood then it will search from the list which type of blood is matched to the required with the help of a machine learning. With the help of email automation, itâ€™ll send email automatically.
