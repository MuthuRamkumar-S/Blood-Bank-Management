# Blood-Bank-Management
A blood bank management system is a website that will collect the information from volunteers and store it in the donor's list. In the future, if anybody registers a need for blood then it will search from the list which type of blood is matched to the required with the help of a machine learning. With the help of email automation, itâ€™ll send email automatically.

This project was created with STS(Spring Tool Suit) and xampp server.  So to run this project you need STS and Xampp in your local system.

I've created this project using Java's framework springboot. And I've used xampp server to store a data.

This website will collect the information from volunteers and store it in the database.  Then if someone register for blood, the machine learning will find out the match of needers blood then it automatically send the eamil to both(needer and donar) using java mail.
